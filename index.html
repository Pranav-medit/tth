            <h3>Ancient History</h3>
            <p>Thirthahalli holds it's place strongly in Indian mythology with the
            ancient story of Parashurama and his father, Jamadagni. Legend has it that
            Parashurama chopped off his mother, Renuka's head with an axe as commanded
            by his father Jamadagni, a great sage. Parashurama then tried to wash off
            the blood from his axe in various rivers but a stubborn sesame sized stain
            remained to his axe. It was only when he dipped it in River Tunga did the
            stain leave his axe. Thus, the people of Thirthahalli believe that a dip in
            the river can wash away one's sins. Thirthahalli takes its name from the
            legend and the river Tunga - Thirtha meaning 'holy water' and Halli meaning
            'village'. The place is also known as 'Parashurama Thirtha' or 'Rama
            Thirtha'. There is a stone temple dedicated to Lord Rama near the 'Rama
            Thirtha'.</p>

            <h3>Story of ancient Temple</h3>
            <img id="par"src="Parush.jpg" alt="Lord Parusuhram">
            <p>Sri Rameshwara Temple is an ancient temple located on the banks of River
            Tunga. Located near the 'Parashurama Thirtha', the temple has a Shiva lingam
            (idol) inside the sanctum is believed to have been placed there by
            Parashurama himself. It is regularly visited by devotees to give their
            offerings to Lord Shiva. Enjoy the unique experience of worshipping God
            alongside mother nature and the cascading River Tunga. If you are looking
            for a tranquil place of worship and is a great spot to meditate along the
            banks of River Tunga, the Rameshwara Temple is the place for you. The day
            Parashurama cleaned his axe to remove the sesame-sized (Ellu in the Kannada
            language) blood stain was Amavasya (New Moon Day) of Margashira month in the
            Hindu calendar. That particular day is termed as Ellu-Amavasya (also called
            Ellamavasye) day and every year on this day a fair termed as Ellu Amavasya
            Jatre is celebrated at great devotion in Thirthahalli.

            <h3>Bridge</h3>
            <img id="brid" src="brid.jpg" alt="bridge image">
            <p>The Tunga Bridge, also known as the Jayachamrajendra Wadiyar bridge, is a
            popular tourist attraction in Thirthahalli. Built over the holy Tunga river,
            it was constructed by the famous architect and scholar Sir M Vishveshwarah.
            The Tunga bridge is known for its arc-like structure at the top supported by
            multiple pillars on either side of the bridge. The bridge was completed in
            1943, and inaugurated by then Maharaja of Mysore,  H. H. Jayachamarajendra
            Wadiyar and consequently named after him. The bridge now connects the town
            of Thirthahalli to its neighbouring village Kuruvalli.</p>

            <h3>Yellamasye Fair</h3>
            <img src="theru.jpg" alt="Chariot" id="ratha">
            <p>The Ellu Amavasya Jatre will last for more than five days, but three days
            are very important for the devotees. On the day of Ellamavasye, the Utsava
            Moorthi (procession idol) of Lord Sri Rameshwara is taken to the river and
            holy Abhishekam is carried out on the idol in the Parashurama Thirtha. After
            this, the devotees take a holy dip at this place. On the second day, the
            temple chariot which is decorated with flowers is pulled along the main
            street of Thirthahalli. This street is call Car Street (Ratha Beedhi in
            Kannada language). The big chariot of the temple which occupies almost the
            entire width of the street, is pulled by devotees and the chariot even
            climbs a steep gradient on this road. On the third day, the Utsava Moorthi
            is taken on a Teppa (raft) on holy river Tunga towards the river bank at
            Kuruvalli and brought back. This celebration is called Teppotsava
            (raft-festival). On this day, a lot of colorful crackers are lit and also
            the river banks, Tunga Bridge and Rama Mantap are decorated with lights.
            This festival normally falls on last half of December or the first half of
            January. This festival attracts thousands of people from the Karnataka
            state.</p>
